# RaspberryPi dotfiles

:wrench: dotfiles for RaspberryPi OS

Most of the configurations are from my [Ubuntu dotfiles](https://github.com/devmatteini/dotfiles), but changed to be more suitable for RaspberryPi.

## Installation

Ssh into your RaspberryPi:

```shell
sudo apt install -y git
git clone https://github.com/devmatteini/raspberrypi-dotfiles ~/dotfiles && cd ~/dotfiles
./bootstrap.sh
```
